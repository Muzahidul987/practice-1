    <p>
        Having been born in a business family and inspired by the environment in which I was brought up, my mind was set
        for doing business from the very childhood. This remained undeterred from the influence of my early education in
        the oldest cadet college in the country followed by the professional education in a number of engineering
        univerisy like WPUET in Lahore, BUET in Dhaka, University of Wales in UK and the various professional training
        in USA,Germany, France, Switzerland, Spain etc. <br><br>

        Not only the formal education in the said institutions, but also the experience gained from a number of years
        involvement with the biggest engineering in Europe during the late 70â€²s have contributed to my developing a
        business with the sole motto of Sales, INstallation, COmmissioning & Service, from where the name SINCOS was
        derived and a company called SINCOS ENGINEERS LTD. Was formed in 1983. <br><br>

        As the name implies; the nature of business of Sincos goes far beyond setting only. It is a total commitment to
        provide complete solutions to hundreds of our customers, who have benefited in various sectors and sub-sectors
        of industry in the country, namely:

        Sincos has been evolved for its customers, by its customers and with its customers for the ultimate satisfaction
        of its customers. <br><br>

        This has resulted in the formation of its sisters company, SINCOS AUTOMATION TECHNOLOGIES LTD. in 2000. The
        company has been supporting almost every industry engaged in mass production relying on automation technology in
        Bangladesh.
        <br><br>
        All these would not have been possible without the sincere support of the team of people who comprise SINCOS.
